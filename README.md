# mathematics

This is a repository to make publicly available all the notes I took for mathematics courses in my undergraduate study. Some are typeset, others are handwritten; some are lecture notes, others are summaries. A lot (most) of these are incomplete, and I make no promises of completing them.

Here is a summary of which courses I made the notes for: 

All courses were taken at the University of Toronto, unless otherwise specified.

Handwritten:

* ``analysis-II-notes``: MAT257: Analysis II taught by Professor Dror-Bar Natan in the academic year 2021-2022. Complete, pending upload. 

Typeset: 
* ``ODEs-theorem-list``: MAT267: Advanced Ordinary Differential Equations taught by Professor Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero in Winter 2022. Incomplete. 
* ``complex-analysis-notes``: MAT354: Complex Analysis taught by Professor Edward Bierstone in Fall 2022. Incomplete. 
* ``group-theory-notes``: 402-0883-63 S: Symmetries in Physics at ETH Zurich taught by Professor Niklas Beisert in Spring 2023. Incomplete.

If you spot any errors in the repository, are named here and would not like to be, or need to discuss anything related to the notes, you can contact me at jalukaharsh_at_gmail_dot_com.
